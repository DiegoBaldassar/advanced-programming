## Reverse order
- Write a program that reads from stdin the length of an array and then store in it the numbers given from stdin. The program should then prints the number in **reverse order**. Remember to properly free the used memory. You should divide the problem in two parts:
  1. Write one **templated** function that creates the array and returns the pointer to the first element of the newly created, and initialized, array.
  2. Write a **templated** function that prints the elements of an array in the reverse order.
  

## Prime numbers
- Populate an array named `primes` containing the first prime numbers up to 100. Consider 2 as the first prime (i.e. `primes[0] == 2`).
