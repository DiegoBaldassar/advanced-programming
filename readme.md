# Advanced Programming [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asartori86/advanced-programming.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asartori86/advanced-programming)

[SISSA webpage](http://www.math.sissa.it/course/phd-course-master-course/advanced-programming)

Provide advanced knowledge of both theoretical and practical
programming in C++ and Python, with particular regard to the
principles of object oriented programming and best practices of
software development (advanced use of version control systems,
continuous integration, unit testing).

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with linux terminal and a text editor (e.g., emacs, vim)
- A bit of knowledge of git is helpful

## Locations
Lecture room is A-005 in the main SISSA building in via Bonomea 265.
On 10/10, 12/10 and 19/10 the class will be held in room A-133.

Depending on the number of the participants, the hands-on sessions will be ginve in A-003 **or** the lecture room (i.e., A-005 or A-133).

## Syllabus

1. Scientific programming environment. You will learn the basic
   ingredients needed to efficiently develop scientific software in
   *nix environment.

2. Introduction to C++. You will learn the logic and the basics of
   C++, the built-in data types and how to effectively use them. Best
   practices in programming will be addressed.

3. Object orientation in C++. The principles of Object-Oriented
   programming will be presented with particular attention to their
   implementations in C++. Some of the most important Design Patterns
   will be discussed.

4. Advanced features of C++11/14/17. Some of the new features of
   standard C++11/14/17 will be introduced and explained.

5. Object-Oriented programming in Python. After a recap of the basics
   of Python, you will learn how to program in object-oriented fashion
   in the Python programming language.
